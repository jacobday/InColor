Our group has decided to make a drawing app. We are going to be using Core Graphics, Photokit, and Core Data.
Our app is going to start with a blank page that is a for drawing. This will use Core Graphics to let the user use their finger or an apple pencil to draw.
This page will have a button in the top right corner that will clear the drawing and reset it, a button in the top left to save the drawing,
and a button in the middle that gives the user a random image to trace. 
The images that the user is able to draw on come from the user's camera roll. They can give access to all of their phots or just select some. 
The app then randomly selects one to show the user.
There is going to be a second view that allows the user to change colors (of the background and pencil) and choose the thickness of their lines when drawing. 
The third view is going to be a table that allows the view their saved drawings. 
These drawings will be be saved to the device with Core Data.
